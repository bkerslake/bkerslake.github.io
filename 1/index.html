                 <div>I created a custom data-analysis solution for Voxel8, a Digital Manufacturing startup backed by Braemer Energy Ventures and ARCH Venture Partners, which was recently acquired by Kornit Digital. By working alongside the lead software engineer, I gained a deeper understanding of internal data and processes to provide efficient and relevant information for leadership. I concluded my internship by presenting my findings to the CEO, CTO, and coworkers, and provided input as to how my data could lead to the increase in effectiveness of future client orders.
